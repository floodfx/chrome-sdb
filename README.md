# Simple DB Tool for Chrome

This tool is built for Simple DB developers everywhere!  Please use it, provide feedback and submit bugs...

## Replaces Simple DB Tool for Firefox
This is a new tool that replaces the old Firefox plugin tool ([Sdbtool](https://github.com/floodfx/sdbtool)) that I wrote a few years back and which has been a PITA to keep updated as Firefox started releasing new updates every couple of weeks and required updating the plugin...  Plus, Chrome is a better plugin environment since you develop with CSS, HTML and JS.

## Chrome Store
I hope to get this listed in the Google Chrome store...eventually.
